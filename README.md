#  Research Paper Recommendation System

- Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a system that allows users to enter a particular topic and receive recommendations for research papers related to it. By web scraping from IEEE and other research paper websites, we aim to provide users with relevant and up-to-date research in their field of interest.

- Methodology: The project will involve the use of TF-IDF and similarity matching between the title and abstract of papers to recommend similar papers to a particular user input.
